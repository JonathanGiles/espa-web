# Hardware Overview

The eSpa project to date focuses on adding home automation support to SpaNet-branded pool controllers. The [firmware](/firmware) is designed to run on the ESP32 microcontroller, which is a popular choice for IoT projects due to its built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.

::: warning
This project will not work on all spa pools. Refer to the [compatibility](/compatibility) page to understand if your spa pool is compatible with this project.
:::

Because of the support for the ubiquitous ESP32 microcontroller, there are a few different ways to build your own hardware to connect to your spa pool. You can either [build your own hardware from scratch](/hardware-custom-build), or you can [buy a pre-built eSpa PCB](/hardware-pcb) to save you the trouble.
