## Features

The eSpa firmware is designed to be easy to use, and to provide a lot of features to integrate your spa pool into your home automation. Some of the features include:

- **Temperature control**: The firmware can control the spa pool temperature, and can turn the heater on and off to maintain the temperature setpoint.
- **MQTT support**: The firmware can publish status information to an MQTT server, allowing you to integrate your spa pool into your home automation system.
- **Web interface**: The firmware provides a web interface that allows you to configure the spa pool settings, such as the temperature setpoint, and many other settings.
- **Easy configuration**: The firmware starts in access point mode, allowing you to connect to the ESP32 and configure it to connect to your home network.
- **OTA updates**: The firmware supports over-the-air updates, allowing you to update the firmware without needing to connect the ESP32 to your computer.
- **Debugging**: The firmware provides a lot of debug information, allowing you to see what the ESP32 is doing, and to diagnose any issues.
- **Customizable**: The firmware is open source, and is designed to be easy to modify and extend (and contribute back to the project!).
- **And more!**: The firmware is under active development, and new features are being added all the time.
