# Firmware Configuration

In a new installation, the firmware will start in access point mode. This allows for you to configure the firmware to connect to your home network. To do this, connect to the ESP32 access point with your phone or computer. The access point will be named `eSpa-wifi-AP`. Once connected to this access point, your phone / computer should connect to the captive portal on the ESP32. This will allow you to configure the firmware to connect to your home network, and to specify the MQTT server to use to publish status information from your spa pool.

Once you save these details, the ESP32 will restart and connect to your home network. You can then access the ESP32 by browsing to the IP address that it has been assigned by your home network. This will allow you to configure the spa pool settings, such as the temperature setpoint, and many other settings.
